# Food Ordering Application

## Application Overview

This food ordering application allows users to plan their meals within a target budget for any given date. Users can set a target cost for an order plan, select food items (pre-saved in the database), and dynamically add them to the plan while ensuring the total cost remains within the target. Once finalized, the order plan, including the selected items, target cost, and date, is saved to a database for future reference.

The application features full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality:

- **Create:** Users can create new order plans with selected food items.
- **Read:** Users can view a list of saved order plans with detailed information, including the date, target cost, and selected items.
- **Update:** Users can edit the target cost and selected items of an existing plan while recalculating costs to meet the budget constraints.
- **Delete:** Users can delete unwanted plans after confirmation, ensuring data integrity and user control.

This application offers a user-friendly interface and robust features, making meal planning simple and efficient.
